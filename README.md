# Tensorflow_Math_Garden

RealTime Digit Recognition built with Tensorflow and OpenCV in python to recognize digits written in CANVAS.

goal : Serving MNIST digit classification model to website through Tensorflow.js

This repository has following stages:

1. Training MNSIT dataset to classify handwritten digits using Tensorflow using Multi layer perceptron.
2. Saving and loading trained model.
3. converting Tensorflow model to Tensorflow.js model to serve through website.
5. Using OpenCv to preprocess the digits written in CANVAS and convert them to Tensors.
6. Predicting results.
