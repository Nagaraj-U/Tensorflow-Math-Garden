# Tensorflow_Math_Garden



RealTime Digit Recognition built with Tensorflow and OpenCV in python to recognize digits written in CANVAS.

This repository has following stages:

1. Training MNSIT dataset to classify handwritten digits using Tensorflow using Multi layer perceptron.
2. Saving trained model.
3. Loading Saved model
4. converting Tensorflow model to Tensorflow.js model to serve through website.
5. Using OpenCv to preprocess the digits written in CANVAS.
6. Hosting.


Serving MNIST digit classification model to website through Tensorflow.js
